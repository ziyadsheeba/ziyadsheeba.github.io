## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Tübingen and a part of the International Max Planck School for Intelligent Systems. I am supervised by [Prof. Claire Vernade](https://www.cvernade.com/), where I am working on bridging the gap between theory and practice of applying reinforcement learning algorithms at scale. 

I graduated from ETH Zürich in 2022 where I studied Robotics, Systems and Control with a focus on Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control. Afterwards, I worked as a machine learning engineer at Merantix Momentum till 2024, where I developed and trained models at a large scale for various industry projects. 

## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning:** RL Theory, Imitation Learning, Offline/Online RL. 
- **Generative Modeling:** VLAs, Diffusion Models, World Models.
