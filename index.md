## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Tübingen and a part of the International Max Planck School for Intelligent Systems. I am supervised by [Prof. Claire Vernade](https://www.cvernade.com/), where I am working on bridging the gap between theory and practice of applying reinforcement learning algorithms at scale. 

I graduated from ETH Zürich in 2022 where I studied Robotics, Systems and Control with a focus on Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control. Afterwards, I worked as a machine learning engineer at Merantix Momentum, where I developed and trained models at a large scale for various industry projects. 

## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning:** RL Theory, Imitation Learning, Offline/Online RL. 
- **Generative Modeling:** VLAs, Diffusion Models, World Models. 

## News

- **[Sep. 2025]** Our paper "Quantization-Free Autoregressive Action Transformer" is accepted as a **spotlight** at **NeurIPS 2025**!
- **[Aug. 2021]** Our paper "Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Systems with Continuous Action Spaces" is accepted at **ICML 2021** in the **RL4RealLife** workshop!
